immutable: does not change after creation


mutable: faciliates operations to be perfomerd on contents
		 updates
		 
		 
linear: arrays queues stacks lists 
		each element is attached which precieves it
		
len(array) = array.length

#list = string , integer, float

list=[1,2,3,4,5]

print(list) -->  [5,4,3,2,1]
list.sort()  
print(list) -->	[1,2,3,4,5]

array based , order based

array list : no unused space

linked list:
data -> pointer to the next list item
head (start) - tail(end)

#set = only holds unique elements
-no order
-delete add new item
-hasing :mapping 
	-searching o(1)
	
	key_1 ---- Hash Function ---- Index1-Value1
	
-for 
	o(n)
	
#stack = sequential acces
top					push - add item to top
					pop - remove item from top
First in Last Out	isEmpty - checks if empty
First out Last in	isFull - checks if full
ctrl+z

ctrl+y redo readd to the stack


#queue = least recently added item, first to join the queue
		 mc'donalds order queue
		 1st order 1st servint to 1st order
